  ## Design
  ### Colour Scheme
  - The quiz is made up  of light colours such as white and light green. I have also added some dark khaki for contrast.
  - [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/) was used to decide which colours complimented eachother.

  ### Typography
  - The Arima font is used for the heading, with Sans Serif as the fallback font. 
  - Work Sans is used in the quiz section, with Sans Serif as the fallback font. I think that this font contrasts well with the headings as it is delicate and neat. 

  ### Imagery
  - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) image has been used for the background.
