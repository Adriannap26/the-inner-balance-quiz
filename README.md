## Design
### Colour Scheme
- The quiz is made up  of light colours such as white and light green. I have also added some dark khaki for contrast.
- [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/) was used to decide which colours complimented eachother.

### Typography
- The Arima font is used for the heading, with Sans Serif as the fallback font. 
- Work Sans is used in the quiz section, with Sans Serif as the fallback font. I think that this font contrasts well with the headings as it is delicate and neat. 

### Imagery

- [Home hero image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-view-of-a-cliff-17902495/)

#### Summary

### Links and Functions

#### Functionality 
- Create a progress bar, the progress bar is made out of spans. The number of spans depends on the number of questions presented in the questionaire. The function creates a span element in the html file every time is sees a question in the questions section. 
- The function then highlights all completed questions by adding a class 'seen' to all questions which have been answered. The 'seen' class is marked as a different colour in css therefore it creates a progress bar which shows how many questions the user has gotten through.
- Questions from the array are inserted into the questions section depending on the index. 
- Answers from the array are inserted into the questions section depending on the index.
